# üåçüó∫ Welcome to Openguess!

You can play right now on https://openguess.pl/ or host it all by yourself!

## How to host it? Here ya go:

First, you need to fill out the `.env.local` with your informations.\
Openguess uses https://supabase.com/ as backend, so you will need to create a free project there.\
Google Maps JavaScript API Key is the second thing you need.\
It might be quite expensive, so remember to cap the quota to not go beyond the free 200$ you get every month for free.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## If you want to host the API too, just open a new terminal window in API's directory and run
### `npm start`

**Congratulations! You are good to go and play Openguess locally, or host it to the public.**
